# Vortex
A collection of mods and extensions for Vortex Mod Manager

## Instructions

When uploading mods and/or extensions, make sure to place them into a subfolder named after the extension. Extension and Mod formats can be found on the Nexus Mods tutorial page.

An example of the extension format would be as follows:

```
    -   extensions\
    -   -   game-action-taimanin\
    -   -   -   actiontaimanin.png
    -   -   -   index.js
    -   -   -   info.json
```
