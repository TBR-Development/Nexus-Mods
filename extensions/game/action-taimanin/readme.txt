Action Taimanin was announced at TGS 2019 as an general audience aimed 3D game set in the Taimanin universe. The starting playable characters unveiled were Igawa Asagi, Igawa Sakura, and Mizuki Yukikaze.

Shortly after the Japanese release, users noticed a remixed version of Au5's "Snowblind" was used in-game but the artist wasn't featured in the game's credits. Gremory Games would then issue an apology for copyright infringement and take measures to avoid similar situations in the future.

In September 2020, it was announced that Action Taimanin would be released globally for PC on Steam, as well as on iOS and Android devices. On May 4, 2021, the Japanese and global server merged with the former folding into the latter. The Japanese server final closure took place on July 27, with urging of Lilith and Gremory for Japanese players to register for a transfer.

The global server celebrated its first anniversary with several in-game events lasting for all of October 2021 with a second anniversary event taking place October 2022. Reception to the second anniversary was negative due to Gremory Games introducing the first paid-only character, Annerose from Koutetsu no Majo Annerose, without prior notice after she won the game's 2022 character popularity poll.

Sequential Planet complimented the game's visuals and performance as well as it being F2P-friendly. However, they criticized the stamina system, combat, and enemy variety. Iyane Agossah from DualShockers included Action Taimanin in his top 10 games of 2020, praising the game's story and calling it "surprisingly good and researched". However, he criticized the aggressive monetization and repetitive gameplay. GameRant called Action Taimanin one of the best free anime games on Steam.
